			<p>Our research in environment, climate and water resources aims to address the impact of human activities on the environment and design systems.</p>
			<p>Research focus areas
				Sustainable environmental system design
				Green or eco-friendly design is becoming increasingly important to effectively merge new sustainable energy and resource recovery technologies to creating built environments that minimize negative impacts on the natural world while enhancing the well-being of organisms and humans. We approach this research via environmental, ecological, social, and economic perspective to achieve a harmonious and sustainable balance.

				Green catalysis for sustainable environment
				Designing new stable and efficient catalysts is crucial for ensuring innovative energy and resource recovery pathways. We examine fundamental photocatalytic processes to integrate real environmental waste streams with photochemical catalysts. This work involves novel photo-catalyst, electrode, and flow cell design to synthesize sustainable fuels and chemicals, and achieve high rates of CO2 conversion into value-added products.
				Note: Put a picture by the side like the one above but it should be pictures suggesting the sub-topic. You can search google with the sub-topic wordings for picture suggestions
				
				Decarbonization via resource recovery and energy conversion
				In other to support our nationâ€™s goals towards a net-zero economy we seek to decarbonize the water and wastewater sectors by developing new GHG mitigation and valorization technologies. Specifically, we endeavor to conduct research towards the achievement of energy positive wastewater treatment and sustainable resource recovery via the integration of new microbial, and electrochemical processes with mature technologies such as anaerobic digestion, photobiological reactors, advanced nitrogen and phosphorus management systems, membrane processes, and biogas recovery processes.
