Welcome to the ReNEWACT Laboratory led by Engr. Dr. Olusegun Abass
Home
Description
We are an environmental research laboratory focusing on the development and design of environmental materials and reactor operations dedicated to climate friendly and sustainable technologies. The latter guarantees efficient configuration and process optimization while minimizing environmental and climate impact by repurposing waste-streams and reducing energy consumption.
Motivation
We believe that excellence in science is a product of teamwork, thus, we partner with academia and industry to create collaborative and community impact innovations driven by social, economic and technological need. We are devoted to the mentorship of the next generation of engineers and scientists. We are committed to creating an enabling environment for all-inclusive human and environmental health and well-being. 
Research Strategy
With the current myriads of environmental challenges, our societies requires the tools and data to shift from a linear approach to resource management to a more multi-disciplinary, sustainable and circular approach.
Dr. Abass and his team at the ReNEWACT Laboratory, Landmark University carries out research at the Water-Energy-Climate Nexus to revolutionize how society views and utilize scarce resources by developing novel processes and tools for resource recovery and decarbonization. Our work spans areas such wastewater treatment and reuse, CO2 photocatalysis, water supply, purification and desalination, agro-based nutrient and waste recovery, remediation and pollution control, and climate change mitigation technologies. More specifically, we engage in the design of sustainable systems using environmental data analytics and tools to identify, quantify, and manage ubiquitous environmental pollutants (e.g. toxic heavy metals, agricultural wastes, PAHs, PFAS), and GHG emissions in our urban water and nutrient cycles. This includes the development of advanced bio/nano-materials, bioprocesses, and machine learning tools to improve environmental resource management and ensure climate resilience.

Research (note: put a picture in front of every page relating to the sub-topic)
Our research in environment, climate and water resources aims to address the impact of human activities on the environment and design systems.
Research focus areas
Sustainable environmental system design
Green or eco-friendly design is becoming increasingly important to effectively merge new sustainable energy and resource recovery technologies to creating built environments that minimize negative impacts on the natural world while enhancing the well-being of organisms and humans. We approach this research via environmental, ecological, social, and economic perspective to achieve a harmonious and sustainable balance. 
Put a picture by the side e.g. (see the picture below)
 

Green catalysis for sustainable environment
Designing new stable and efficient catalysts is crucial for ensuring innovative energy and resource recovery pathways. We examine fundamental photocatalytic processes to integrate real environmental waste streams with photochemical catalysts. This work involves novel photo-catalyst, electrode, and flow cell design to synthesize sustainable fuels and chemicals, and achieve high rates of CO2 conversion into value-added products.
Note: Put a picture by the side like the one above but it should be pictures suggesting the sub-topic. You can search google with the sub-topic wordings for picture suggestions

Decarbonization via resource recovery and energy conversion
In other to support our nation’s goals towards a net-zero economy we seek to decarbonize the water and wastewater sectors by developing new GHG mitigation and valorization technologies. Specifically, we endeavor to conduct research towards the achievement of energy positive wastewater treatment and sustainable resource recovery via the integration of new microbial, and electrochemical processes with mature technologies such as anaerobic digestion, photobiological reactors, advanced nitrogen and phosphorus management systems, membrane processes, and biogas recovery processes.
